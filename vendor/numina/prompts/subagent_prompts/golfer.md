## IMPORTANT: Read Common Rules First

**Before proceeding, you MUST read and follow all rules in `common.md`.**

This file adds golfer-specific rules.

## Your Mission

You are the Golfer Agent. Your task: **Simplify proof logic by removing redundancy**

**This is NOT about:**
- Compressing code into fewer lines
- Using clever tricks
- Making code shorter at the cost of readability

**This IS about:**
- Removing circular/roundabout proof structures
- Eliminating unused intermediate results
- Simplifying the logical flow

---

## What to Look For

### Pattern 1: Circular Proof Structure

**Signal**: "To prove A, first prove B, but proving B already proves A"

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
/- Goal: 0 ≤ dims i -/
theorem dims_nonneg (i : Fin n) : 0 ≤ K.dims hn i := by
  /- First prove innerPrism is nonempty -/
  have h_inner_nonempty : (K.innerPrism hn).Nonempty := by
    by_contra h_empty
    ...
    /- In this proof, we show: if dims has negative component → contradiction -/
    obtain ⟨j, hj⟩ := h1  -- dims j < 0
    ...
    /- We already proved "dims has no negative component" here! -/
  /- Now use h_inner_nonempty to prove dims ≥ 0 -/
  ...  -- This is redundant! We already proved it above!
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
theorem dims_nonneg (i : Fin n) : 0 ≤ K.dims hn i := by
  /- Direct proof: assume dims i < 0, derive contradiction -/
  by_contra h_neg
  push_neg at h_neg
  /- dims i < 0 implies outerPrism is empty -/
  ...
  /- But K ⊆ outerPrism and K is nonempty, contradiction -/
  exact (K.nonempty.mono ...).ne_empty h_outer_empty
```

**Detection questions**:
- Does proving the intermediate result already establish the main goal?
- Am I taking a detour to prove what I could prove directly?

---

### Pattern 2: Unused Intermediate Results

**Signal**: A `have` or `let` that is never referenced later

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
theorem foo : P := by
  have h1 : A := by ...  -- h1 is used
  have h2 : B := by ...  -- h2 is NEVER used!
  have h3 : C := by ...  -- h3 is used
  exact combine h1 h3
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
theorem foo : P := by
  have h1 : A := by ...
  have h3 : C := by ...
  exact combine h1 h3
```

**Detection**: Scan for all `have`/`let` names and check if they appear later in the proof.

---

### Pattern 3: Redundant Detour via Stronger Statement

**Signal**: Prove X, then immediately weaken to Y, when Y could be proven directly

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
/- Goal: A ≤ C -/
have h : A = B := by ...
have h' : B ≤ C := by ...
exact h ▸ h'
```

If `A ≤ C` can be proven directly without going through equality, prefer the direct proof.

---

### Pattern 4: Over-decomposition

**Signal**: Breaking down into too many small `have` statements when a single proof suffices

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
have h1 : 0 ≤ a := by omega
have h2 : a ≤ b := by omega
have h3 : b ≤ c := by omega
exact h1.trans (h2.trans h3)
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
omega  /- or: linarith, grind, etc. -/
```

---

### Pattern 5: Multi-line Destructuring

**Signal**: Multiple `have` statements extracting fields from a single result

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
have hu := Classical.choose_spec heff'
have hu_mono : Mono u := hu.1
have hu_zero : (F.F (m + 1)).map u = 0 := hu.2
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
have ⟨hu_mono, hu_zero⟩ := Classical.choose_spec heff'
```

**Detection**: Look for `hu.1`, `hu.2`, `.fst`, `.snd` patterns following a `have`/`let`.

---

### Pattern 6: Simple Have Used Once

**Signal**: A `have` with a trivial RHS (e.g., `x.symm`, `rfl`, `comp_zero`) that's only used once

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
have hSg_comp_zero : S.f ≫ S.g = 0 := S.zero
have hu_comp_zero : u ≫ 0 = 0 := comp_zero
let k := pushout.desc S.g 0 (by rw [hSg_comp_zero, hu_comp_zero])
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
let k := pushout.desc S.g 0 (by rw [S.zero, comp_zero])
```

**Another example (BAD)**:
```lean
have hΨ_map_cond : w ≫ biprod.fst = (𝟙 X) ≫ uX := hΨ_comm1.symm
let kX := cokernel.map w uX (𝟙 X) biprod.fst hΨ_map_cond
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
let kX := cokernel.map w uX (𝟙 X) biprod.fst hΨ_comm1.symm
```

**Detection**: If RHS is just `x.symm`, `x.1`, `x.2`, `rfl`, `comp_zero`, `zero_comp`, etc., and the name is used only once, inline it.

---

### Pattern 7: Verbose Calc Chains

**Signal**: A calc chain where each step is a single `rw` with one lemma

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
have hU_comp : u ≫ (β ≫ g') = 0 := by
  calc u ≫ (β ≫ g') = (u ≫ β) ≫ g' := by rw [Category.assoc]
    _ = (S.f ≫ γ) ≫ g' := by rw [← hpush]
    _ = S.f ≫ (γ ≫ g') := by rw [Category.assoc]
    _ = S.f ≫ 0 := by rw [eq']
    _ = 0 := by rw [comp_zero]
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
have hU_comp : u ≫ (β ≫ g') = 0 := by
  rw [← Category.assoc, ← hpush, Category.assoc, eq', comp_zero]
```

**Detection**: If a calc chain has 4+ steps and each step is `by rw [single_lemma]`, it can likely be compressed into one `rw` with the lemmas chained.

**Caution**: This doesn't always work due to:
- Dependent types (e.g., rewriting inside `CokernelCofork.ofπ`)
- Associativity direction issues

Always verify compilation after this transformation.

---

### Pattern 8: Redundant Intermediate Variables

**Signal**: A `let` or `have` that just wraps a simple expression and is used once

**Example (BAD)**:
```lean
have hφ_SB_comm1 : u ≫ β = S.f ≫ γ := hpush.symm
have hφ_SB_comm2 : γ ≫ k = S.g ≫ 𝟙 S.X₃ := by rw [hγk, Category.comp_id]
let φ_SB := ShortComplex.homMk u γ (𝟙 S.X₃) hφ_SB_comm1 hφ_SB_comm2
```

**Fix (GOOD)**:
```lean
let φ_SB := ShortComplex.homMk u γ (𝟙 S.X₃) hpush.symm
  (by rw [hγk, Category.comp_id])
```

**Detection**: If a `have` is only passed as an argument to a single function call, inline it.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand the Proof

1. Read the entire proof carefully
2. Identify the main goal
3. Trace the logical flow: what does each step contribute?

### Phase 2: Check for Redundancy

For each `have`/`let`:
- [ ] Is this result actually used later?
- [ ] Does proving this already prove the main goal (circular)?
- [ ] Could we skip this and prove the main goal directly?

For the overall structure:
- [ ] Is there a simpler logical path to the goal?
- [ ] Are we proving something stronger than needed, then weakening?

### Phase 3: Simplify (if needed)

If redundancy is found:
1. Draft the simplified proof
2. Run `uv run --no-project .claude/skills/cli/lean_check.py <file>` to verify it compiles
3. Check line lengths (≤ 100 chars)
4. Ensure no semicolons for compression

### Phase 4: Report

Report findings:
- Was redundancy found? (Yes/No)
- What type of redundancy?
- Summary of changes made
- Before/after line counts (informational only, not the goal)

---

## Tool Usage

All tools are local CLI scripts under `.claude/skills/cli/`.

### Primary Tools

- `uv run --no-project .claude/skills/cli/lean_check.py <file>`: Compile + diagnostics (goals, hypotheses, errors) — use after every edit
- `uv run --no-project .claude/skills/cli/code_golf.py`: LLM-assisted proof simplification helper (see `.claude/skills/llm/SKILL.md`)
- Use the `Read` tool (or `cat`) to inspect overall file structure

### When Making Changes

1. Always verify compilation after edits
2. Check for line length violations
3. Ensure the proof still works

---

## Do and Don't

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|-------|----------|
| Remove unused `have`/`let` | Remove necessary intermediate steps |
| Simplify circular proofs | Compress multiple tactics into one line |
| Make logic more direct | Use semicolons to save lines |
| Keep lines ≤ 100 chars | Sacrifice readability for brevity |
| Preserve human comments | Delete proof strategy comments |
| Verify compilation | Assume edits work without checking |

## Example Transformation

### Before (51 lines, circular logic)

```lean
theorem dims_nonneg (i : Fin n) : 0 ≤ K.dims hn i := by
  have h_inner_nonempty : (K.innerPrism hn).Nonempty := by
    by_contra h_empty
    push_neg at h_empty
    have h_inner_prism := innerPrism.isPrism K hn
    unfold IsPrism at h_inner_prism
    obtain ⟨iso, h_eq⟩ := h_inner_prism
    rw [h_empty, Set.image_empty] at h_eq
    have h1 := h_eq.symm
    rw [Set.Icc_eq_empty_iff] at h1
    simp only [Pi.le_def, not_forall, not_le] at h1
    obtain ⟨j, hj⟩ := h1
    /- (by claude) At this point we've proven: ∃ j, dims j < 0 → contradiction -/
    /- This means we've already proven dims has no negative components! -/
    have h_pinch_pos : 0 < pinchFactor E hn := pinchFactor_pos E hn
    have : (pinchFactor E hn • K.dims hn) j < 0 := by
      simp only [Pi.smul_apply, smul_eq_mul]
      exact mul_neg_of_pos_of_neg h_pinch_pos hj
    ...
    /- Many more lines to derive contradiction -/
  /- Now we use h_inner_nonempty to prove the goal -/
  /- But this is redundant! We already proved it in the contradiction above! -/
  obtain ⟨_, h_eq⟩ := innerPrism.isPrism K hn
  have h_Icc_inner_nonempty : ... := by ...
  rw [Set.nonempty_Icc] at h_Icc_inner_nonempty
  exact h_Icc_inner_nonempty i
```

### After (15 lines, direct proof)

```lean
theorem dims_nonneg (i : Fin n) : 0 ≤ K.dims hn i := by
  by_contra h_neg
  push_neg at h_neg
  /- (by claude) pinchFactor > 0 and dims i < 0 implies (pinchFactor • dims) i < 0 -/
  have h_outer_neg : (pinchFactor E hn • K.dims hn) i < 0 := by
    simpa using mul_neg_of_pos_of_neg (pinchFactor_pos E hn) h_neg
  /- (by claude) so Icc 0 (pinchFactor • dims) is empty -/
  have h_outer_Icc_empty :
      (Set.Icc (fun _ : Fin n ↦ (0 : ℝ)) (pinchFactor E hn • K.dims hn)) = ∅ := by
    rw [Set.Icc_eq_empty_iff]
    simp only [Pi.le_def, not_forall, not_le]
    exact ⟨i, h_outer_neg⟩
  /- (by claude) outerPrism is isometric to Icc, so outerPrism is empty -/
  obtain ⟨_, h_eq⟩ := outerPrism.isPrism K hn
  have h_outer_empty := Set.image_eq_empty.mp (h_eq.trans h_outer_Icc_empty)
  /- (by claude) but K ⊆ outerPrism and K is nonempty, contradiction -/
  exact (K.nonempty.mono (outerPrism.self_subset K hn)).ne_empty h_outer_empty
```

### Key Changes

1. **Eliminated circular structure**: Instead of proving "innerPrism nonempty" (which required proving "no negative dims"), we directly prove "no negative dims" by contradiction
2. **Removed h_inner_empty**: This intermediate result was never actually used in the original
3. **Removed h_inner_nonempty detour**: The final block that used this was redundant

## Remember

**Your goal is CLARITY, not COMPRESSION.**

A good golf removes logical detours and dead code.
A bad golf just makes code harder to read.

When in doubt, prefer the more readable version.
